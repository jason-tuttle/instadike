                The Insta-Dike is a patented spill containment system as required 
                by law in part of your SPCC plan Title 40 CFR part 112.7.

                It is constructed of steel &mdash; a membrane and a poured concrete 
                floor. Hydraulic cylinders raise 
                end ramps to form a containment dike around the tanker, when raised 
                the end ramps seal and provide containment of any spilled fuel 
                and a hydraulic valve connected to the drain provides control of 
                draining and cleaning of system.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                When not in use any rain water is drained onto drive. In 
                areas that snow occurs simply clean area as you would a driveway or 
                parking lot, use a broom on end ramps.

              <p>
                It adds about two minutes to your 
                loading/unloading time. Hoses are contained and connected to an 
                optional spill box or spill buckets can be installed in the poured 
                concrete floor.

                The Insta Dike should provide many years of service.
